 DCIT 318 - Assignment 1

This repository contains three C# console applications developed as part of the DCIT 318 assignment. The applications included are:

1. Grade Calculator
2. Ticket Price Calculator
3. Triangle Type Identifier

Grade Calculator

The Grade Calculator prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100 and then displays the corresponding letter grade based on the following scale:
- 90 and above: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F

How to run:
1. Navigate to the `GradeCalculator` directory.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE or editor.
3. Build and run the application.

Ticket Price Calculator

The Ticket Price Calculator prompts the user to enter their age and calculates the ticket price based on the age entered. A regular ticket price is GHC10, but if the customer is a senior citizen (age 65 and above) or a child (age 12 and below), they receive a discounted price of GHC7.

How to run:
1. Navigate to the `TicketPriceCalculator` directory.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE or editor.
3. Build and run the application.

Triangle Type Identifier

The Triangle Type Identifier prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines the type of the triangle. The possible types are:
- Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene: No sides are equal.

 How to run:
1. Navigate to the `TriangleTypeIdentifier` directory.
